# Enhanced Extinguishing

The Enhanced Extinguishing addon changes how placing Torches and Lanterns works in the Aether dimension. It removes the normal mechanic of disallowing their placement, and instead makes it so that placing these blocks will convert them into extinguished variants: the Extinguished Torch and Extinguished Lantern, respectively.

These two blocks resemble their lit counterparts, but both appear to have their flame extinguished and give off no light. This change makes placing these blocks more consistent with the behavior of other blocks in the Aether like Campfires and Candles, which convert to an unlit state. Similarly, breaking the Extinguished Torch and Extinguished Lantern will return their lit counterpart, just like Candles.

If youâ€™re feeling a bit more adventurous or wish to help test the in-development versions, we provide **bleeding edge builds** which are produced on [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/The-Aether-Team/Enhanced-Extinguishing). These builds are created for every new commit and contain the latest available code. We do not recommend users treat these builds as releases, as they are unfinished and may contain serious issues. If you wish to download these builds, check out [this guide](https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/The-Aether/wiki/CircleCI-Guide).
